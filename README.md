# My Website

Includes both the HTML page and the CSS file. I run this project with Visual Studio Code and with the LiveServer add-on. The font used throughout this website comes from Google Fonts.

I have used Sections, Classes, Headings, Attributes, Paragraphs, DIV Tags, ID's, Breaks, Unordered Lists, and a Footer to build up the HTML page.

In the CSS file, I have implemented Media Queries. This means that at different screen sizes, the page will fit the screen correctly instead of either being too large or too small.
