# My Website

An amalgamation of everything I learned during my HTML & CSS Bootcamp. I was taught HTML & CSS by Colt Steele in his Udemy course "The HTML & CSS Bootcamp". I acknowledge him and thank him for his teaching! This project has been expanded upon with my designs and additions.

Includes both the HTML page and the CSS page. I run this project with Visual Studio Code and with the LiveServer add-on. The font used throughout this website comes from Google Fonts.

I have used Sections, Classes, Headings, Attributes, Paragraphs, DIV Tags, Breaks, Unordered Lists, and a Footer to build up the HTML page.
