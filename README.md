# My Website

Includes both the HTML page and the CSS file. I run this project with Visual Studio Code and with the LiveServer add-on. The font used throughout this website comes from Google Fonts.

I have used Sections, Classes, Headings, Attributes, Paragraphs, DIV Tags, ID's, Breaks, Unordered Lists, and a Footer to build up the HTML page.

In the CSS file, I have implemented Media Queries. This means that at different screen sizes, the page will fit the screen correctly instead of either being too large or too small.

On the webpage itself, I talk about who I am, my experiences & education, and I list my skills.
